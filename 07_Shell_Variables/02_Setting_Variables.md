# Setting Variables

Obtaining the flag by setting the variables using `=`

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{YeYmBTMZ-dWfJL6LGvJhm1egrix.QX5UTN0wCO2gjNzEzW}`
- The challenge requires us to set the value of PWN equal to COLLEGE

```
PWN=COLLEGE
```

## What I learned
Variables can be set using `=` but there should not be any space between them.
