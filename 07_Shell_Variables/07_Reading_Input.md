# Reading Input

Setting the value of PWN to COLLEGE using `read` to get the flag

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{wAQ8snylwOkErpgMoQyOCq-74Q9.QX4cTN0wCO2gjNzEzW}`
- We set the value of `PWN` to `COLLEGE`
- Use `read -p` to get the flag by typing and command and pressing enter once `PWN` shows

```
PWN=COLLEGE
read -p PWN
```

## What I learned
The `read` command reads the standard input as compared to `echo` which reads the output
