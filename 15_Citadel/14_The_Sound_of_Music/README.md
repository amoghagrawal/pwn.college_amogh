- First instinct was to check Soundcloud but there was nothing there
- Next on searching 
- Found this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/7kyw95/music_rating_website_like_imdb/) for some of the music websites to try which included Rate your Music, Album of the Year, Album Music Ratings
- On the [RYM profile](https://rateyourmusic.com/~citadweller) we get 2nd part of the flag
- The tinyurl link points to spotify which has the 3rd part
- Now for the last part I tried a lot of websites but none had the part
- Ultimately trying [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/citadweller) to get the first part
