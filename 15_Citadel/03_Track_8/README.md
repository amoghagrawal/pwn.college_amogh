# WRITEUP

- The cipher might be a vigenÃ¨re cipher as it requires a key
- On [cryptii.com](cryptii.com), decoding the intial cipher as vigenere with the key **Ginkgo** which is Panchiko's latest album
- We get the result `rigckmv{osd_ikumqog_tjkjm}`
- Again using the vigenere cipher but **panchiko** as the key to get the final flag
