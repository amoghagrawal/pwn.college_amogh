# Multiple Globs

Using multiple globs `*` in a command

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{kDLuq3RaoO45A1rDuF6kPGh7RO3.0lM3kjNxwCO2gjNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge/files
/challenge/run *p*
```

## What I learned
Having two globs like `*p*` searches for arguements starting with nothing or something, having `p` and then ending with nothing or something
