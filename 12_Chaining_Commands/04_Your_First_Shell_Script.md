# Your First Shell Script

Make a shell script and execute it to get the flag

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{cJxqE2AQT_x468EPoss5hj0IYeq.QXxcDO0wCO2gjNzEzW}`
- We create an script file called x.sh having the command for us
- On running the file as an arguement to the command `bash` we get the flag

```bash
# x.sh
/challenge/pwn ; /challenge/college
```

```
bash x.sh
```

## What I learned
We can make shell scripts with the file extension **.sh** and call them in the shell using `bash`
