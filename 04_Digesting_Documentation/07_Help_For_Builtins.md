# Help for Builtins

Finding arguements for commands without a manual using `--help` or `-h`

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{g4d_zOyh_LZk7_XdDS4_sokcn1V.QX0ETO0wCO2gjNzEzW}`

```
help challenge
challenge --secret g4d_zOyh
```

## What I learned
Some commands like `cd` have their help commands builtin in the shell rather than being a seperate command which can be accessed using `man`
