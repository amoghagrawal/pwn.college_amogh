# grepping for a needle in a haystack

Using `grep` to search for text in files

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{M99C2lhWBQvZIT0Q9wYtjtYk7vo.QX3EDO0wCO2gjNzEzW}`

```
grep pwn.college /challenge/data.txt
```

## What I learned
`grep` is used to find lines having a specific string in fils, in our case the flag contains `pwn.college` which is a common thing across all flags
