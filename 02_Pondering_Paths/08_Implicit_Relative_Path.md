# implicit relative path

Running a program in the current directory using `./`

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{YsdkFsbux_5itXyOTZfhYNrQEvE.QXwUTN0wCO2gjNzEzW}`

```
cd /challenge
./run
```

## What I learned
linux doesnt execute programs in the current directory automatically to prevent accidental executation so run program in the challenge directory needs to executed using `./`
