# home sweet home

`~` is the home/hacker directory 

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{A3yQ_88AKw0ySDgoYQzrgJz0YyI.QXzMDO0wCO2gjNzEzW}`
- rewrites the flag from /challenge/run to ~/f directory

```
/challenge/run ~/f
```

## What I learned
in the dojo we start in the home directory which is `/home/hacker` and has our personal files and is denoted by `~` to save time
