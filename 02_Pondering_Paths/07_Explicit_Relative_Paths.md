# explicit relative paths, from /

Using explicit relative paths with `.` from the root directory

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{YsdkFsbux_5itXyOTZfhYNrQEvE.QXwUTN0wCO2gjNzEzW}`

```
cd /
./challenge/run
```

## What I learned
we can refer to the current directory using `.` in paths like `/challenge` and` /challenge/.` are same
