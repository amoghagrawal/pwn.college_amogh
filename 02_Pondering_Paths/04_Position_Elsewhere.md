# Position elsewhere

Changing to another directory and running the program

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{cVg2laPebKi_p4xNIxc6zL0ZHHK.QX3QTN0wCO2gjNzEzW}`

```
/challenge/run
cd /usr/share/build-essential
/challenge/run
```

## What I learned
we run `/challenge/run` to get the directory in which we need to run the flag, we change directories using `cd`
