# implicit relative paths, from /

Using relative paths from the root directory `/`

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{EMJmV4i2qt-uyviAVYbKB4vMK8-.QX5QTN0wCO2gjNzEzW}`

```
cd /
challenge/run
```

## What I learned
instead of running the program from `/challenge/run` which is an absolute path, we navigate to `/` and then use a relative path `challenge/run`
