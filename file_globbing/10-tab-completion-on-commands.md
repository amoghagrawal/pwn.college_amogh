# Tab Completion on Commands

Using the tab key for autocompletion of a command

## My solve
**Flag** `pwn.college{AOILdcTKihpDxlx34F54XzaScx4.0VN0EzNxwCO2gjNzEzW}`
- Here `pwncollege` is a command and we have to press tab to autocomplete it to get the flag

```
pwncollege-20562
```

## What I learned
Tab autocomplete can work on both commands and files but we need to be careful before using it as not to run the wrong command
